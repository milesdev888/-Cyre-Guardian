name: cyre-guardian
description: Risk-grade a Solana wallet, scan a token mint, or get a signed Guardian Passport before an agent transacts. Pay-per-request in USDC via x402 (Base mainnet). Use when the user mentions CYRE, Guardian, wallet risk, address check, token scan, rug check, counterparty check, passport, or wants to know if a Solana address or mint looks risky before sending funds, swapping, or trusting a counterparty. Patterns, not verdicts.

# CYRE Guardian

Guardian reads on-chain history and returns explainable risk signals — each with points and a plain-English reason — so an agent can decide for itself. It never says "safe" or "scam"; it shows patterns.

Three paid endpoints, one free verifier. No API keys, no accounts. Listed on Agentic Market (agentic.market → search "guardian").

| Endpoint | What it does | Price |
|---|---|---|
| `GET https://cyre.dev/api/address?address=<base58>` | Wallet risk profile: score 0–100, LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH, six signals, activity profile | $0.005 USDC |
| `GET https://cyre.dev/api/token?mint=<base58>` | Token mint facts: mint/freeze authority, supply, holder concentration | $0.01 USDC |
| `GET https://cyre.dev/api/passport?address=<base58>` | Signed, 24-hour Guardian Passport attestation of a wallet's measured risk — present it to a counterparty | $0.005 USDC |
| `GET https://cyre.dev/api/passport/verify?token=<token>` | Verify any passport (signature, issuer, expiry) | Free |

Payment network: **Base mainnet (eip155:8453), USDC.** A Solana lane also appears in the 402 offer but is currently devnet — pay on Base.

## How to pay

Any x402 client works. The endpoint returns HTTP 402 with the price; your client signs a USDC payment and retries; Guardian settles it and returns the result in the same call.

**Shell-capable agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.) — Coinbase Agentic Wallet:**

```bash
npx awal status                     # signed in + funded on Base? if not: npx awal auth login <email>
npx awal x402 pay "https://cyre.dev/api/address" --query '{"address":"<base58>"}'
npx awal x402 pay "https://cyre.dev/api/token"   --query '{"mint":"<base58>"}'
npx awal x402 pay "https://cyre.dev/api/passport" --query '{"address":"<base58>"}'
```

**MCP hosts (Claude Desktop etc.) with the Coinbase payments tools:** use `check-payment-requirements` on the URL, tell the user the cost ($0.005 or $0.01), then `make-x402-request`.

**Any other x402 v2 client:** standard flow. The 402 body follows x402 v2 (`accepts[]`, `resource`, `extensions.bazaar`), header `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`; send `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.

## Guardian MCP server (alternative to raw HTTP)

Listed in the official MCP registry as `io.github.milesdev888/guardian`. Streamable HTTP at `https://cyre-fraud-prediction.onrender.com/mcp` with tools `grade_address`, `scan_token`, `batch_grade`. Same x402 pricing.

## What you get back

### /api/address

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "address": "9WzD…AWWM",
  "score": 24,
  "riskLevel": "LOW",
  "signalsTriggered": 1,
  "signalsEvaluated": 6,
  "signals": [
    { "id": "burst", "name": "Activity burst", "points": 24, "triggered": true,
      "detail": "45 transactions in the last 24 hours" },
    { "id": "age", "name": "Wallet age", "points": 0, "triggered": false,
      "detail": "Active for at least 33 days — history runs deeper than the 1,000-transaction window" }
  ],
  "profile": { "ageDays": 33, "ageIsMinimum": true, "idleDays": 0, "transactionsSeen": 1000,
               "last24h": 45, "failedPercent": 2, "longestGapDays": 0, "balanceSol": 9188448.31 },
  "checkedAt": "2026-08-29T15:57:24Z"
}
```

Signal ids: `age`, `burst`, `failures`, `dormant`, `balance`, `history`. Score bands: LOW < 20, MEDIUM 20–44, HIGH ≥ 45. A fresh/empty wallet returns `empty: true` with a low score — absence of history is a pattern too, not a pass.

### /api/token

```json
{
  "mint": "EPjF…Dt1v", "name": "USD Coin", "symbol": "USDC",
  "supply": 7979328128.74, "decimals": 6,
  "mintAuthorityRevoked": true, "freezeAuthorityRevoked": true,
  "top1Pct": 12.3, "top10Pct": 41.0, "holdersMeasured": true, "holdersSource": "index",
  "score": 0, "risk": "LOW",
  "signals": [ { "level": "good", "text": "Mint authority revoked — supply is fixed." } ]
}
```

Scoring: active mint authority +30, active freeze authority +25, top holder > 20% +15, top-10 > 60% +15. LP lock status is **not** assessed — say so if the user asks.

### /api/passport

Everything in `/api/address` plus `mintAffinity` (exposure to major RWA/stable mints) and:

```json
"attestation": {
  "token": "<base64url(claims)>.<base64url(sig)>",
  "claims": { "kind": "cyre-passport-attestation", "iss": "cyre.dev", "address": "…",
              "score": 24, "riskLevel": "LOW", "issuedAt": "…", "expiresAt": "…" },
  "verifyUrl": "https://cyre.dev/api/passport/verify?token=…",
  "issuerPublicKey": "28M17SKBx_OsO1ZRPBp7BFMWzI77OXVC3UbLYbNqgQw"
}
```

Also returned in the `X-Guardian-Passport` header. To verify offline: Ed25519 over canonical JSON of `claims` (keys sorted at every level) with the issuer public key, then check `expiresAt > now` and `iss === "cyre.dev"`. Passports expire after 24 hours — re-issue for a fresh one.

## Rules for using the result

- **Patterns, not verdicts.** Report the score, the level, and the triggered signals with their `detail` text. Do not tell the user an address is "safe" or "a scam."
- HIGH does not mean stop; it means show the user why before they proceed. LOW does not mean go.
- Large `balanceSol` with a burst is often an exchange or program, not a person — say so.
- Not investment advice. Not a KYC/AML determination.

## Costs and refusals

- You are only charged on a successful result. A bad address (400), a mint that doesn't exist (404), or "not a token mint" (400) are refused **before** any payment settles.
- Repeated 402 = your wallet lacks USDC on Base. Check `npx awal balance` or the wallet UI.
- 502 "RPC busy" = Solana RPC hiccup; retry. Nothing was settled.

## Free for humans

The same checks are free on the website: `https://cyre.dev/check` (address) and `https://cyre.dev/scan` (token). If the user is a person, not an agent, send them there.
